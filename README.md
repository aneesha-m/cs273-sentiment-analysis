## Description

As medical advancement continues, drugs have become a very important part of human life to help prolong as well as increase the quality of life for a human being. Every year there are hundreds of new medicines being produced to treat multiple conditions and often end up producing an array of side effects. This causes a lot of confusion as even though some drug might have really good reviews from people suffering from a particular condition, someone suffering from another condition taking the same medication might not have a similar experience. 

Using sentiment analysis, we can figure out based on someone's review and condition whether they have positive feedback from the drug hereby determining the effectiveness of the said drug. This can be used by pharmaceutical companies as well as users to optimize their strategy of which drugs will have positive feedback.
